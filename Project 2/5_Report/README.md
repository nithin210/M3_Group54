# _BiCom System_

# Introduction: 
        A BiCom system is the extention of the unidirectional Remote Keyless Entry(RKE) to bidirectional Remote Keyless Entry(RKE)
        system. Bicom Systems uses open standards telephony.
              • The BiCom system is the advancement of unidirectional RKE to bidirectional RKE system.
              • This system enables the transfer of data from both the ends.

# Swot Analysis:
## Strengths:
    • Optimum  Convenience and Security
    • No need of human interaction
    
## Weakness:
     • Security is improving, but some systems have been susceptible to hacking and cars have been stolen this way.
     • If we lost the Remote it will take great effort to make one and lose of time
     
## Oppurtunities:
     • Increase in growth of automobile industries.
     • Financial scenery around the globe and positive deals position raised interest of the part.
     
## Threats:
     • Could be hacked.
     • Failure of Machine/Remote
     • Key fob cloning.
